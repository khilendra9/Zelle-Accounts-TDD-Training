# ZELLE02: Feature, Step Definitions, and Code Skeleton

## Project Overview

- Step definitions provided
- Skeleton for Zelle Account, but no functionality yet

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
3. Check the `ZelleAccountSteps.cs` file, here implemented all logical structure under steps file.
4. Running the tests will pass, as the actual logic is not implemented in main `src`.
